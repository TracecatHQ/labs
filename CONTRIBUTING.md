# Contributing a lab

Every lab uses the shared Tracecat evaluation loop. A lab contributes Case
Templates, a Rubric, two agent presets, and only the target-specific services or
Judge helpers it needs. Do not add a lab CLI, provisioning plugin, copied
Tracecat checkout, or Python control runtime.

## Naming

| Item | Convention |
|---|---|
| Lab directory | Next zero-padded number: `NNN/` |
| Candidate preset | Name `Candidate`, slug `candidate` |
| Judge preset | Name `Judge`, slug `judge` |
| Standard workflows | `Candidate Run` / `candidate_run` and `Judge Run` / `judge_run` |
| Helper workflow file | Kebab case, such as `validate-firewall-rule.yml` |
| Helper workflow alias | Snake case, such as `validate_firewall_rule` |
| Case Template ID | Stable kebab case |
| Rubric and criterion IDs | Stable kebab case |

The Case is the Candidate's unit of work. Candidate-visible analysis, evidence,
timelines, and answers belong in the Case description or comments. The Oracle
contains hidden expected facts. The Rubric describes how the visible Work
Product is graded. There is no separate “COT” object.

```

Use only `README.md` for lab documentation. Put source attribution next to the
asset it describes or in the README; do not add `IMPLEMENTATION.md` or a
lab-level `PROVENANCE.md`.

## Create a lab

1. Choose the next `NNN` directory and copy
   [`templates/lab-readme.md`](templates/lab-readme.md) to `NNN/README.md`.
2. Add Case Templates and the Rubric under `NNN/evals/`. Populate relevant
   `case.tags` and, for cases evaluating a specific target,
   `case.payload.target_id` according to the Case Template contract.
3. Add Candidate and Judge instructions under `NNN/tracecat/agent_presets/`.
4. Add the minimal `tracecat.json` manifest. Omit empty optional sections.
5. Add only the target services to `compose.yml`. Add a Judge helper workflow
   only when deterministic scoring needs to exercise the target.
6. Copy the closest existing `terraform/main.tf`, change `lab_id`, and retain
   only the credential variables the lab uses.
7. Add target variables to the root `.env.example`; do not create a per-lab
   environment file.
8. Add the lab to the root README table and run `just check`.

The root Justfile discovers directories matching `NNN/` automatically. Adding a
lab must not require another CLI command or a lab-specific Just recipe.

## Case Template contract

`evals/cases.ndjson` contains one complete evaluation unit per line:

```json
{"schema_version":1,"case_id":"stable-case-id","case":{"title":"Candidate-visible title","description":"Candidate-visible question","priority":"medium","severity":"medium","tags":[],"fields":{},"dropdowns":{},"payload":{}},"oracle":{"criteria":{"criterion-id":{"expected":"hidden expected result"}}}}
```

Use `case.tags` as an array of strings for candidate-visible technologies,
behaviors, and CVEs where applicable. Use `case.payload.target_id` for a stable
target identifier: the full Vulhub directory such as `bash/CVE-2014-6271`, or a
built-in ID such as `n8n`. Do not infer CVEs from a product name or put hidden
Oracle answers in tags. For cases without target identity, omit `target_id`;
empty tags are valid. Labs 001 and 002 currently use empty tags and no target ID.

The shared grader extracts this metadata automatically from frozen submitted
Cases; no lab-specific grader code is needed. Updating fixtures affects future
runs, not historical snapshots. See the Results contract for aggregation rules.

Keep each lab to at most 200 Case Templates, Tracecat's maximum table page size.
Split a larger suite into multiple labs instead of adding pagination machinery
to the standard Candidate Run.

Terraform stores the Case Template, Oracle, and Rubric in the Tracecat
`case_templates` table. Candidate Run creates the Trial Case from `case` only;
the Candidate preset has no table access. After the submission cutoff, Judge
Run combines the frozen Submission with `oracle` and the Rubric. Every Oracle
criterion key must match one Rubric criterion ID. Keep executable verifier
fixtures in the helper workflow and only their expected outcomes in the Oracle.
Candidate Run may also attach
platform-captured call and result events to the Trial as `tool_audit`. Events
are joined by `tool_call_id`; call events contain tool names and inputs, while
result events record success. This is verifier metadata, not private model
reasoning.

## Rubric contract

`evals/rubric.json` is the single scoring contract for every Case Template in a
lab:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "rubric_id": "lab-NNN-purpose",
  "rubric_version": 1,
  "criteria": [
    {
      "criterion_id": "criterion-id",
      "label": "Human-readable criterion",
      "weight": 100,
      "hard_gate": false,
      "judge_instruction": "What evidence makes this met or missed."
    }
  ]
}
```

Non-gate weights must total 100. Hard gates have weight 0 and force the Trial
score to 0 when missed. The Judge returns every criterion exactly once as
`met` or `missed`, with a reason and evidence references.

A criterion may additionally declare classification reporting metadata:

```json
"metric": {
  "type": "classification",
  "labels": ["true_positive", "false_positive"]
}
```

The Oracle's `expected` value must be one of those labels. The label
`__abstain__` is reserved for missing predictions in reports. For classification
criteria the Judge also returns a normalized `predicted_label`; missing or
ambiguous predictions are null. Rubric weights continue to determine business
scores, while support determines weighting in classification summaries.

## Tracecat manifest contract

The shared module creates the workspace tables, Candidate Run and Judge Run,
and a shared single-agent subworkflow. The parent workflows iterate that
subworkflow because the pinned Tracecat release does not loop
`ai.preset_agent` actions directly.
The lab manifest declares the two presets and only its optional integrations,
secrets, and helper workflows:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "agent_presets": [
    {
      "name": "Candidate",
      "slug": "candidate",
      "description": "Candidate task.",
      "instructions_file": "agent_presets/candidate.md",
      "actions": ["core.cases.get_case", "core.cases.update_case"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Judge",
      "slug": "judge",
      "description": "Grades the captured Work Product.",
      "instructions_file": "agent_presets/judge.md",
      "actions": [],
      "retries": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Candidate presets must not have table access. Judge presets receive hidden
material through Judge Run; grant them only the helper action they require.

Optional credential mappings keep the generic `just plan` and `just apply`
wrappers free of lab-specific branches. Map Tracecat field names to root `.env`
variable names in the object that consumes them:

```json
{
  "mcp_integrations": [{
    "catalog_slug": "example-mcp",
    "credentials_from_env": {"Authorization": "EXAMPLE_MCP_AUTHORIZATION"}
  }],
  "secrets": [{
    "name": "lab_NNN_target",
    "keys_from_env": {"API_TOKEN": "LAB_NNN_API_TOKEN"}
  }]
}
```

Terraform receives these values through ephemeral, sensitive variables; the
manifest stores only environment variable names.

Managed workflow YAML is source-owned: edit it locally and apply Terraform.
Do not commit workflow changes from the Tracecat canvas; the API normalizes
committed definitions, so this minimal provider intentionally does not compare
exported canvas state with source YAML.

## Results contract

The shared module writes `case_templates`, durable `evaluation_runs`,
`evaluation_scores`, and per-trial `evaluation_trial_details`. The Candidate
Run execution ID is the Evaluation Run ID;
Candidate Run persists its immutable Trial snapshot in `evaluation_runs`, and
Judge Run reads that native Tracecat table. `just grade NNN RUN_ID=...`
validates execution completion, result coverage, score arithmetic, and hard
gates before writing this fixed CSV schema:

```text
schema_version,lab_id,evaluation_run_id,trial_id,case_id,trial_number,candidate_session_id,judge_run_execution_id,judge_session_id,rubric_id,rubric_version,criterion_id,criterion_weight,criterion_result,criterion_points,criterion_hard_gate,trial_hard_failed,trial_score,reason,evidence_refs,candidate_completed_at,judged_at
```

Do not add lab-specific score columns. Put lab-specific detail in criterion IDs,
reasons, and evidence references.

The same directory receives `summary.json` with a sorted, deduplicated `tags`
array from the frozen submitted Cases (including CVE tags where present),
`target_ids` from their `payload.target_id` values, and `target_id` when there
is exactly one distinct target. Target IDs preserve the full Vulhub directory
(e.g. `bash/CVE-2014-6271`) or built-in ID (`n8n`). Missing target metadata
produces `target_ids: []` and `target_id: null`; multiple distinct targets
produce the full sorted, deduplicated array and `target_id: null`. The report
also includes score distribution, criterion and hard-gate rates, workflow and agent timing, and classification metrics when
available. Tags are informational Case metadata, not grading evidence, and
are an empty array when unavailable. They are never read from current lab
fixtures when grading historical runs. The classification report includes
confusion matrices, accuracy,
balanced accuracy, macro and support-weighted F1, MCC, per-class metrics, and
joint exact match for multiple outputs. Undefined values are null. The
standalone `just export` recipe remains available for raw criterion export but
does not perform grading integrity checks. The grader uses only the Go standard
library and owns its Terraform-output decoding, Tracecat HTTP access,
validation, and report generation.

## README contract

Every lab README follows [`templates/lab-readme.md`](templates/lab-readme.md)
with exactly these sections:

1. Task
2. Scoring
3. Target
4. Agent access
5. Run

Keep implementation details in configuration files. The README should explain
the evaluation contract, prerequisites, access boundaries, and commands.

## Validate and run

```bash
just check
just tracecat-up
just init NNN
just up NNN
just plan NNN
just apply NNN
just run NNN
just status NNN RUN_ID=<candidate-run-id>
just judge NNN RUN_ID=<candidate-run-id>
just status NNN RUN_ID=<judge-run-id>
just grade NNN RUN_ID=<candidate-run-id>
```

A lab is ready when Terraform can plan it, Candidate Run creates fresh Trial
Cases and returns immutable Trials, Judge Run scores every Trial, the CSV
exports with the shared schema, and `just check` passes. Inspect the generated
`summary.json`: verify that `tags` and `target_ids` match the submitted Cases,
that full Vulhub IDs are preserved, and that `target_id` is populated only for
one distinct target. Cases without metadata should produce empty arrays and
`target_id: null`. This report inspection is part of validating every new lab.
Repeated measurements are separate Candidate Runs, not repetitions inside one run.
