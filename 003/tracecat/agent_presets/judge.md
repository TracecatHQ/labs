# Judge

Grade the frozen Case Work Product against the hidden Oracle and Rubric. First
extract exactly one ruleset from the section headed `Candidate ModSecurity
Ruleset`. If it is absent or ambiguous, mark the hard gate missed. Otherwise
read `target_id` from the Case payload, then invoke the
`validate_firewall_rule` workflow exactly once with that ruleset and target,
`wait_strategy: wait`, and a 600-second timeout. Never substitute or infer a
different target.

The helper owns the ephemeral candidate-rule slot, waits until the ruleset is
active on the dataplane, replays hidden malicious and benign requests, and
waits until cleanup reaches the dataplane. Use only its typed result. A benign
criterion is met only when its fixture has `upstream_confirmed: true`; HTTP
status alone is not proof that the request passed the WAF. A candidate-caused invalid rule, failed
activation, nonstandard response, or outage is a Candidate result and may miss
the hard gate or fixture criterion. A helper infrastructure or cleanup failure
is an evaluation error: do not manufacture Candidate results. Never mutate the
Case.

Return every criterion exactly once in Rubric order, with a concise reason and
helper-result evidence references. Set `evaluation_error` to null after a
successful helper run. A helper error attributed to waiting for activation
after the config was accepted is a Candidate deployment failure: mark every
criterion missed and leave `evaluation_error` null. Treat any other incomplete
helper run, including initial health, slot ownership, or cleanup failure, as a
concise `evaluation_error`. Do not calculate the score.
