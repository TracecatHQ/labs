# Lab 002 — BOTSv3 Alert Classification

Classify 20 BOTSv3 alerts using exact, bounded evidence objects.

## Task

Each Case Template contains a sparse alert and one read-only BOTSv3 object URL.
The Candidate queries that object with DuckDB and records two independent
decisions, with Case-scoped evidence:

- `determination`: true positive or false positive
- `incident_relevance`: related or unrelated to the main BOTSv3 intrusion

## Scoring

Case-scoped evidence access is a hard gate: Tracecat's captured tool audit must
show at least one successful DuckDB query, and every audited query must read
only the immutable evidence object named by the hidden Oracle. Missing, failed,
or out-of-scope access scores zero.
Determination is then worth 50 points and incident relevance is worth 50
points. Formatting, embeddings, entities, memory, and private reasoning are not
scored.

## Target

Lab 002 starts a MinIO evidence target and seeds it from the pinned archive in
`assets/`. Set `BOTSV3_ACCESS_KEY` and `BOTSV3_SECRET_KEY` in the root `.env`.

## Agent access

The Candidate has Case actions and read-only DuckDB queries. It cannot access
evaluation tables or workflows, call arbitrary HTTP endpoints, or use the
internet. The Judge has no tools.

## Run

Run from the repository root:

```bash
just tracecat-up
just init 002
just up 002
just plan 002
just apply 002
just run 002
just status 002 RUN_ID=<candidate-run-id>
just judge 002 RUN_ID=<candidate-run-id>
just status 002 RUN_ID=<judge-run-id>
just grade 002 RUN_ID=<candidate-run-id>
```

`just grade` writes `scores.csv` and `summary.json` under
`002/results/<candidate-run-id>/`.
The current Case Templates have empty tags and no target ID, so summaries
contain `tags: []`, `target_ids: []`, and `target_id: null`.
Metadata comes from frozen submitted Cases, so later fixture edits do not
change historical reports.
